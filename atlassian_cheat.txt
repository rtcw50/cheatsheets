Stash:
======
- Create personal repository
  - Browse to sw-stash.freescale.net
  -  (far right pulldown) "View Profile"
  - "Create repository"
  - After repository is created, click on it and you should
    be presented with a page with "Files" and "Settings" tabs.
  - "Settings" tabs allows you to set permissions.

  you can use git commands on your client to push changes
  to the repository.

     vi <file>

   - Add a file
     git add <file>|--all

   - Commit to your local repo
     git commit -m "comments"

   - Push to server
     git push origin master 

- Push a change with ssh command.
   - git commit -m "added some changes" <file>
